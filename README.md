## General Rules for this git repository
</br>
Each student in the group will have different tasks and some of them might result into changes in the same file, therefore we can't work all on the same branch.
Before starting doing your task you MUST:</br>
Open an Issue for your current task. The name of the issue will have the following structure: ID: "name of the task". There can't be 2 issues with same ID. </br>
Create a new branch related to your issue (github will propose to do this for you, but if you choose to do this manually, the branch must have the same name as the issue it's related to.)</br>
After you finished doing your work and you tested the functionality, create a merge request with master, see if you have any git conflicts, solve them and after that you can push to master.</br>
</br>
By following this simple rules we can be sure that someone's mistakes will not affect the work of other students.
